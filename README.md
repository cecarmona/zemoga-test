# Carlos Carmona - UI test for Zemoga

Hi Zemoga team,
Thank you for this opportunity, it means a lot to me!

## Technologies

To build this project I used:
HTML5, CSS3 with SASS, Vanilla JS, and GSAP Library for a couple of animations.

## Use

The app contains some data storaged on JSON structure variable "cardContent[], you could change them for your preference values.

## Description

I think the project is very complete according to your requirements,
The app is mobile-friendly and the "Votes" functionality is dynamic and works well, however I can't complete the part where the data is stored in local storage,
This is because for the company I currently work with, I have projects with very demanding deadlines in charge, so I was sharing the time between doing the test and the other projects.
But don't get me wrong, I know it's not an excuse.
I hope you like my work and we can move forward in the selection process.
Regards and have a happy "coding" day!
